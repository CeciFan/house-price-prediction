Haygarth House has a wealth of history being the former Rectory to All Saints Church and formerly the home of Reverend Richard Clyfton, who founded the Pilgrim movement.
Haygarth House previously operated as a successful equine stud farm, racing yard and conference centre and presents the perfect opportunity for purchasers in this sector.
The gardens surrounding the house were originally designed and laid by Humphry Repton. They are mostly laid to lawn, split by an inviting gravel path flanked by low level box hedging.
The property would suit conversion to a boutique hotel or wedding venue (subject to planning permission), with its direct access to All Saints Church (Babworth Church) via a private walk way.
