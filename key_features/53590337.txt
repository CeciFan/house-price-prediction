Representing superb value for money and deceptively spacious 1 bedroom park home
Enviably positioned and currently having an open aspect to the rear
Just 13 miles from the Georgian market town of Retford, 12 miles from the Historic town of Lincoln and only 51 miles from the East Coast
View early to avoid disappointment
